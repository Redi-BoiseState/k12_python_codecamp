## Python Code Camp: Environmental Data Science Workshop for Middle and High chool Teachers

### Goal 
Introduce teachers to interactive computing for environmental data analysis and show an on-ramp to data science that involves exploring environmental issues.

### Workshop Learning Outcomes
At the end of this workshop you will be able to:
* Create, modify, and save an interactive Python computing artifact known as a Jupyter Notebook
Read in, describe, and summarize attributes of an environmental dataset
* Create, edit, and save simple figures developed from underlying environmental datasets
* Use Notebook features to create scaffolded learning exercises
* Complete the conceptual conceptual design of a Notebook-based example that could be integrated into a Middle School classroom

### Example Educational Standard Alignment
* SSSS
