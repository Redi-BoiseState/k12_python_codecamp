    "1. Evaluate sequences of code given to you in a Jupyter Notebook\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Background and Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "What you're using right now is called a Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter is a portmonteau of \"Julia, Python, and R\" -- the languages that these notebooks are designed to support natively. Old timers like me may also sometimes refer to them as \"iPython notebooks,\" because they were initially designed to support only the Python programming language. These are referred to as \"high-level\" programming languages because we use them at a \"high level\" â€“ that is, we give the computer a set of commands in something that is close to being human readable and the computer will interpret those commands and perform a series of tasks. Python, Julia, and R are all also often referred to as scientific computing languages because they are languages frequently used by scientists or others to do data analysis, interpretation, and visualization. Python is, however, a bit of an oddball because it is also used for a lot of other applications like web development. \n",
    "\n",
    "The essential feature that makes Jupyter Notebooks powerful tools for teaching, learning, as well as data science and research is that they are ___interactive___. That is, we can write and evaluate code one chunk at a time. A chunk could be a single line or it could be hundreds of lines (perhaps not wise). But either way, we can stop along the way to make sure that our code is doing what we expect it to do before proceeding. \n",
    "\n",
    "These chunks of code are contained in what refer to as _cells_. Enough reading, though, let's get started and see what this looks like. The following is a cell of code. Click on it and press the \"play\" icon or simply press \"Shift-Enter\" if on a PC or \"Cmd-Return\" on a Mac."
